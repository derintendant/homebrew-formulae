pandoc
------
[pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) is an awesome document converter that's great for converting Markdown to anything. Unfortunately it's a bit a pain to build since compiling from source requires ghc/haskell-platform and I got tired of that, so this formula installs from the official binary packages.
